## What is this project?
womenInTechNTX is a resource for young women in North Texas who are interested in the technology industry. It's designed to be collaborative and let women share opportunities for camps, scholarships, conferences, and more.

## Who created this?
My name is Liz Wigglesworth, and I'm a high school student. Over the past few years, I've gone to camps and other events for young women in technology whenever I heard about them. Initially, I just wanted to make a list of opportunities to send to my friends and the other girls in the computer science classes at school. I realized that lots of women could benefit from something like this, so I decided to make something bigger. I'm excited to see where this project goes!
