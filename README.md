# womenInTechNTX

This repository is a website/information hub for young women in North Texas who are interested in the technology industry.

## Goals of this Project
- **To act as a central resource** for young women who are seeking out opportunities in technology
- **To foster collaboration and community** - it's easier to find opportunities when everyone is looking for them together

## Why?
Initially, I just wanted to keep track of the tech camps for young women that I had attended so I could share them with my friends. However, I realized that other women could benefit from this, so I knew I had to do something bigger. A collaborative website through GitHub Pages is the solution!
